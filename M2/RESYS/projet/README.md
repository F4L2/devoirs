Project 7: Epigenetics marks and targets
Epigenetics is one of the most promising fields of modern molecular biology. Temporary DNA
modifications are suspected of having a significant impact on a wide range of processes, from
carcinogenesis to the adaptation of an organism to the environment. The full list of effets of
each of these modifications remain relatively unknown at the moment, although we can already

categorize epigenetic marks into two major groups based on their effect on expression : En-
hancers, that promote the transcription of the targeted gene; and silencers that limit or silence

transcription the target gene. Other major players in epigenetics are the proteins that affix or
remove these marks: histone deacetylases, methylases,...
This project aims to reconstruct the existing relationships between markers and marks, using
a standardised dataset summarising the presence of several marks and epigenetic markers at
regulatory sites of 26893 human genes. Apart from the fact that the role of markers is to place
or remove these marks, their action can be favoured/disadvantaged by the presence of one or
more brands.

- Learning the human chromatin network from all ENCODE ChIP-seq data


Main steps:
- Get familiar with the dataset, understand the distinction between marks and targets
- Choose and run an appropriate network inference method. Here you can run the approach
several times : do you want a network of interactions between targets? marks? marks and
targets?
- Analyse your results, paying close attention as to how the links were removed/retained
- Use online resources to confirm on infirm some of the predicted (non)interactions in your
networks
