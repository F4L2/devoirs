Exercice 1 :

1.	Helicobacter_pylori:	

	The purple line is almost a diagonal
	The blue line is mostly scattered but we can notice 2 small anti-diagonal bits that inversly complete the purple diagonal. 
		
	-Relocations : 38
	-Insertions : 228
	-Deletions :  ? 


2. 	Pgingivalis_33277 | Pgingivalis_381

	We can see an almost perfect purple diagonal
	And completely scattered blue points that form anti-diagonals but this is seemingly due to randomness

	-Relocations : 4
	-Insertions : 2
	-Deletions :  ?

	
	Pgingivalis_33277 | Pgingivalis_HG66

	We can see short diagonals formed here and there for both colors.
	But they never follow the same direction. 

	-Relocations : 19
	-Insertions : 72
	-Deletions :  ?


Exercice 2:

1. 	Increasing the threshold reveals synteny blocks. Inversely decreasing patterns increase the noise that enveils those blocks. 


3.	Yes, we can see a well-conserved block

4.	We can see there's 2 conserved regions
	One start from Phat1 to Phat6.
	The other one start from Phat8 to the Phat18. 

5.	Yes, there's plenty. knowlesi contig only contains some 'Phat' genes while falciparum contains a lot more families and even phat genes 		not annoted in knowlesi contig.

6.	(optional)

7.	We can see at least 5 conserved blocks
	Some genes are not present on both sequences, such as L2969.01



Exercice 3:


2.	The dentist performed on already infected patients, it's very unlikely he did any wrong here. 

3.	The bootstrap indicates we can be half sure about the location of the dentist patients' clade. 
	Nevertheless according the the actual location of the dentist clade (in the infected clade), and the fact that we are sure of the separation between infected and the control patients. 
	We are actually pretty confident that the dentist is not guilty.
