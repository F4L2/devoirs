The parameters directly infer on the simulation
1.3
Yes, the parameters don't change during the whole simulation. Physics don't change according to an organism

There's an event that never happen
WGD:		0
We notice that the mutation which did not happen is complex and imply a large scale modification.
It did not happen weither because the energy cost or because the mortality risk is too high.  
We know for a fact that this event happens, the probability might just be very low.

The trees are similar in the sense that both describe the same order of speciation. 
But the reconstructed one have more precise distance values (NJ-like) where the simulated one have fixed end distances (UPGMA-like)
