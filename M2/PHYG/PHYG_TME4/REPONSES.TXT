EXERCICE 1

1)	With thousands of species, some specy might not share the same genes and therefore makes the comparison between between species difficult. 
	There's 2 main strategies for reconstructing multiple gene phylogenic trees, first is to concatenate all the sequence alignment of each specy to form a supermatrix that will infere the consensus tree. The second method is to find the maximum agreement tree from all the trees infered from the sequence alignment of each specy. 

2)	MAST: Try to fit the most leaves into the trees, at the condition that the leaves' edges are not ambiguous (for the same selection of leaves, and in each trees, a specific leaf must not have different edges). 
	MCT: Basically MAST but on trees which are not necessarly binary.


EXERCICE 2

1) 	commentaires: 	distance matrix from alignment (use 'protdist') to use neighbor
			execute proml directly (doesn't need distance matrix) 

2)	The neighbor tree is more evenly distributed than the proml tree, 
	as the neighbor-joining tree is more globular shaped while the maximum likelyhood tree is more linear shaped

EXERCICE 3

1)	commentaires: 	concatener tous les alignements (pour les mêmes espèces, append les séquences)
			>specy1
			seqA1+seqA2+seqA3+.... #concat sequences of same specy from all famillies
			>specy2
			seqB1+seqB2+seqB3+....

			aligner en fasta puis convertir en format phylip

2)	The neighbor tree have more average branch length in the sense that we don't see as much very short branch as in the maximum likelyhood tree.
